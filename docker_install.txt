my c++ program has three source files: main.cpp, foo.h, foo.cpp,
the main function in main.cpp calls foo function which involved foo.h, foo.cpp,
this program is developed on debian linux machine.

my c++ program will be compiled and tested by test team on separate test
machine. how do i use docker for my c++ program, so the test team can use same
compiler, libraries, and environment like it on my own development machine?

and, what if my program replies on a library of specific version,
eg. libxml-2.12, from debian repository.

and again, what if my program contains a custom private library,
eg. libbar.so of my own.

# install docker community edition:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
docker --version

If your C++ program relies on a specific version of a library (like libxml),
and also includes a custom private library (like libbar.so), you will need to
ensure that these dependencies are included in your Docker environment. Below
are the steps to handle both scenarios using Docker.

Step 1: Update the Dockerfile for Library Dependencies

You will need to modify your Dockerfile to install the specific version of
libxml2 and include your custom library. Hereâ€™s an updated version of the
Dockerfile:

```

# dockerfile

# Use the official Debian image
FROM debian:bullseye

# Set environment variables for library paths
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# Install build tools and the specific version of libxml2
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y \
    g++ \
    make \
    cmake \
    libxml2=2.12.* \      # Specify the exact version or pattern as needed
    libxml2-dev=2.12.* \  # Include development files for compiling
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*  # Clean up

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the source files into the container
COPY . .

# Copy the custom library into the appropriate directory
# Assuming 'libbar.so' is in the same directory as your Dockerfile
COPY libbar.so /usr/local/lib/

# Optionally run ldconfig to refresh shared library cache
RUN ldconfig

# Compile your program with the required libraries
RUN g++ -o my_program main.cpp foo.cpp -lxml2 -L/usr/local/lib -lbar

# Command to run the compiled program
CMD ["./my_program"]

# or,
# Set the entrypoint to run the program
#ENTRYPOINT ["./my_program"]
#CMD []

```

Step 2: Prepare Custom Library

Ensure that your custom library (libbar.so) is available in the same directory
as your Dockerfile. The COPY command in the Dockerfile will copy this file into
the /usr/local/lib/ directory inside the Docker image. After copying, we run
ldconfig to refresh the shared library cache, which helps the dynamic linker
find libbar.so.

Step 3: Build the Docker Image

You can build your Docker image as before:

bash
docker build -t my_cpp_program .

Step 4: Run the Docker Container

Once built, you can run the image with:

bash
docker run --rm my_cpp_program

# or,
docker run -it --rm my_cpp_program /bin/bash
./my_cpp_program

# or,
docker run -d --rm my_daemon_service


Handling Custom Libraries and External Dependencies

Library Versioning: By specifying the version of libxml2 in the apt-get install
command (e.g., libxml2=2.12.*), you ensure that the Docker image uses the
desired version. Make sure that this version is available in the Debian
repository you're targeting.

Custom Libraries: If you have more custom libraries, follow the same pattern as
libbar.so:

Copy them into the appropriate location using the COPY instruction.
Ensure they are linked correctly during the compilation step by including the
-L flag (to specify the library path) and the -l flag (to specify the library
name without the lib prefix).

Example Project Structure

Your project directory structure should look like this:

/your_project_directory
|-- Dockerfile
|-- main.cpp
|-- foo.h
|-- foo.cpp
|-- libbar.so  # Your custom library

Testing the Environment

Once you have set everything up, you can test your program within the Docker
container to ensure that all dependencies are correctly resolved and that the
program behaves as expected.

Use supervisord if your program needs auto-restarting.


Summary

By updating your Docker setup to include specific library versions and custom
libraries, you create a complete and isolated environment for your C++ program.
This method allows consistent building and testing across different machines,
making it easier for the test team to validate functionality against the
specific dependencies you've defined.
